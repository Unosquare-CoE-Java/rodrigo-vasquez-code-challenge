* Create a list data structure that works following the next set of rules:
* - push method: any new element is inserted at the back, the list consists of unique elements if an element already exists the operation is ignored
* - pop method: returns the element located at the top of the list and removes the element from the list
* - get method: returns the element located at the index N, in which N is an integer value provided as parameter 
* - max size: the list will support max 5 elements, in case of an overflow the first element that was read the least amount of times will be removed.
* Example: 
*   push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), push(5), push(2), get(2), get(3), get(3), get(2), get(1), push(7), pop()
